        <h1>Prevention and Precautions</h1>
        <p>You know the dangers. How do you prevent tragedy?</p>

        <h2>Inside the Vehicle</h2>

        <h3>Heat Stroke/Hypothermia:</h3>
        <p>Position your child&rsquo;s car seat on the passenger side to see your child easier.</p>
        <p>Stage your car with cues to help remember your child:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Keep a stuffed animal in the car seat at all times. When you buckle baby in, place it on the dash or in the passenger seat.</li>
        <li>Keep important items you will need in the backseat with baby.</li>
        <li> Keep your vehicle stocked with toys &lpar;not small enough to be choked on&rpar; to keep your child awake and giving auditory prompts of their presence.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Many devices and apps are now available to help you remember your child.</p>

        <h3>Choking:</h3>
        <p>Clean your vehicle regularly &ndash; especially of small objects such as trinkets, toys, or stray food items that may have fallen into hidden spaces; be sure to look under seats and in storage areas.</p>
        <p>You should never leave a small child unattended while they are eating.</p>
        <p>Children should never eat in the car.</p>
        <p>If your child must eat in your vehicle, remain parked and never leave them unattended.</p>
        <p>Feed your child at home before or after your errands.</p>
        <p>Keep your vehicle clean and free of loose small items.</p>

        <h3>Front-overs/Back-overs:</h3>
        <p>Average blindzone: 15-25 feet &lpar;shorter drivers have a greater blindzone&rpar;</p>
        <p>Teach your children that any vehicle can move</p>
        <p>Keep toys out of the driveway</p>
        <p>Know where your children are before moving a vehicle</p>

        <h3>Vehicle accidentally set in motion:</h3>
        <p>Shut the vehicle off and lock it when you leave it</p>
        <p>Keep your car locked when not in use</p>
        <p>Keep keys out of reach of children</p>

        <h3>Power Windows:</h3>
        <p>When children are riding, engage the child safety lock</p>
        <p>Shut the vehicle off and lock it when you leave it</p>
        <p>Teach children that power windows are dangerous</p>

        <h2>Outside the Vehicle</h2>
        <p>Always bring your child with you when you exit the vehicle – no amount of time is safe to leave your child unattended in the vehicle, even for “just a minute”, and it is illegal to do so in some states</p>
        <p>Be sure that you lock the vehicle’s doors and trunk after exiting with your child – even when parked and at home, a vehicle can endanger a child, as they can become trapped within it if left open</p>
        <p>Instruct children that the vehicle is not a safe place to play</p>

        <h2>In General</h2>
        <p>Familiarize yourself with life-saving techniques such as the Heimlich Maneuver, child cardiopulminary resuscitation (CPR), and other first-aid measures, and call 911 for emergencies.</p>
        <p>Be sure your child's caretaker(s) are aware of the dangers and solutions, and always have a plan of action in case of emergency.</p>
        <p>Be aware of your child's behavior and condition: if they are acting strange or confused, or if they are exhibiting nausea, dizziness, sudden cessation of sweating, or quick/slow pulse, they may be suffering heat stroke.</p>
