                    <h3>How it Happens:</h3>
                        <p>Sleeping babies are quiet. A rushed parent is likely to be focused on many things. Especially when caring for your child at the time is outside of your normal routine, a sleeping child can be forgotten.</p>
                        <p>Parents are not always aware of these risks and leave their child while they quickly go inside a location on an errand. &ldquo;It was just for a minute,&rdquo; is the most common response to one of these tragedies.</p>

                        <p>A child left alone in your car after a long day of shopping has access to many items you may not think are dangerous. Grocery bags can be filled with many items that can make your child sick and can even be toxic, such as:</p>
                        <p>- Cleansers/Bleach<br /> - Lotions/Hand sanitizer<br /> - Tobacco products<br /> - Adult beverages<br /> - Automotive products (De-icer, oil, flares, etc.)<br /> - Food items that have been sitting in a vehicle for extended periods (Mold/Bacteria can be fatal to a young child&rsquo;s weak immune system)</p>
                        <p>Think that some of these sound outrageous or extreme? Remember, a toddler is apt to put ANYTHING in his/her mouth.</p>

                <ul>
                    <p>A frontover is when a driver doesn&rsquo;t see a child in front of the vehicle and goes forward, accidentaly bumping into the child. A Backover is when a driver doesn&rsquo;t see a child behind the vehicle and backs up.</p>

                    <li>Of all nontraffic fatalities involving children under 15 years old from 2006 to 2010 30% of those were from Frontovers while 34% were from Backovers.</li>
                    <li>Frontovers and Backovers can happen in any vehicle because all vehicles have a blind zone which is the area in front of a vehicle where you can&rsquo;t see from the driver&rsquo;s seat.</li>
                    <li>The predominant age of backover victims is one year old.</li>
                    <li>Over 60% of back up incidents involved larger size vehicle such as a truck, van, or SUV.</li>
                    <li>Sadly in a little over 70% of these incidents, a close relative or parent are usually the ones behind the wheel.</li>

                    <h3>Abduction</h3>
                    <p>Children left alone in a vehicle are vulnerable to being taken.</p>
                    <p>Unattended children have access to door locks. Easily influenced, a stranger can coerce them into unlocking the vehicle.</p>
                    <p>A stranger doesn&rsquo;t need to forcefully take the child. Persuading them to exit the vehicle with temptations is just as much a threat as breaking a window and taking the child.</p>
                    <p>It can only take a few seconds for your child to be taken.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, a child can be unintentionally abducted should a stranger attempt to steal your vehicle.</p>
